# home_automation_using_arduino
I have developed an application to control the house appliances. Basically controlling the light, fan and door were the major motive of the project. Each user of the house is given a user-id and password, so that the details of the logged-in user is saved the database. The front-end of this project is Visual Studio and the user needs to log-in using their credentials and then can control the appliances. The backend of the project is local in-built SQL server. Arduino is used as a microcontroller, servo motor as door, brushed motor as fan, led as light.
